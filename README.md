[Glossika](https://ai.glossika.com/) looks *amazing*. (I read about it via [John McWhorter](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/14/opinion/learn-foreign-language.html).)

Poking around the website in the browser's JavaScript console, I found it has a concept of "demo sentences"

> Specifically, https://ai.glossika.com/api/session on a session returns a `demo_sentence_full` object with a table called `demo_source_sentences` of a sentence in many languages, with audio URLs. It refers to languages with keys which can be expanded by another table, in https://ai.glossika.com/app/locales/eng-US/language.json.

I wanted to easily see and hear all this so I made this [webpage](https://fasiha.github.io/glossika-example-sentence-1).
